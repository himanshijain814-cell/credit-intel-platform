📊 Real-Time Explainable Credit Intelligence Platform

🚀 Problem
Traditional credit ratings are slow to react to new information.  
Investors and analysts need a faster, more transparent credit scoring system that reacts in near real-time to:
- Market movements (stock prices, volatility, spreads),
- Macroeconomic indicators (rates, inflation, yield curve),
- News & events (press releases, downgrades, lawsuits, earnings calls).

## ✅ Our Solution
We built a **real-time explainable credit scorecard** that:
1. **Continuously ingests multi-source data**
   - Structured: Yahoo Finance, FRED/SEC EDGAR
   - Unstructured: Company news & press releases (RSS feeds)
   - Fault-tolerant & scalable
2. **Computes adaptive credit scores (0–100)**
   - Updates every few minutes
   - Maps into bands (A, BBB, BB, B, CCC)
   - Supports incremental updates + nightly retrain
3. **Explains every score clearly (No LLMs)**
   - Feature contribution breakdowns via SHAP
   - Short-term vs long-term trend indicators
   - Event log (e.g., *guidance cut*, *downgrade*, *lawsuit*) with source links
4. **Interactive Analyst Dashboard**
   - Score timeline + feature importance visualization
   - Event timeline with clickable news sources
   - Alerts for sudden score changes
5. **Deployable Anywhere**
   - Docker + Docker Compose setup
   - FastAPI backend + React frontend
   - Postgres for structured data, MinIO for raw files
